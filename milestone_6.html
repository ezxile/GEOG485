	  <h1>Milestone 6</h1>
	  		<h3>There are a large number of WMS services available on the web. One way to find interesting services is to search for them using standard search engines such as Google. Try searching for the following search phrase:
				<ul>
				<li><i>“REQUEST=GetCapabilities” and “SERVICE=WMS”</i></li>
				<li>as a single search phrase</li>
				</ul>
	    <h2>Question 1</h2>
	    	<h3>What search engine did you use?</h3>
        		<ul>
        		<li>I used Google Search</li>
        		</ul>
      	<h2>Question 2</h2>
        	<h3>How many 'hits' did you get?</h3>
        		<ul>
        		<li>28,300 hits</li>
        		</ul>
	    <h2>Question 3</h2>
	     	<h3>How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services [defined as a functioning GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?</h3>
       			 <ul>
       			 <li>The hits were very useful, the descriptions that came with each result helped define what type of data I was looking at.</li>
       			 </ul>
       		<h3><i>Pick two of the services that included live "GetCapabilities" requests that you found above, and answer the following questions about each.</i></h3>
       	<h2>Question 4 (Service 1)</h2>
       		<h3>a. What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?
			<br>b. What is the Name of the service?
			<br>c. What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?
			<br>d. How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>a. http://dss.csiss.gmu.edu/cgi-bin/wms_cdlall?SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetCapabilities</li>
				
				<li>b. Cropland Data Layer WMS Service</li>

			<h3>Open the following GetCapabilities request in your browser. Select “View Source” from the browser menu to see the delivered XML document (it may appear as an unformatted string of text by default in your browser - if that is the case, save the file to your hard drive and view it in a text editor). Use the information in the XML capabilities document to formulate GetMap requests for the following map images. Include the requests and resulting images in your write-up. Comment on anything unusual that you notice in the images that are returned.
