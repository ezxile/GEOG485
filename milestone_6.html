	  <h1>Milestone 6</h1>
	  		<h3>There are a large number of WMS services available on the web. One way to find interesting services is to search for them using standard search engines such as Google. Try searching for the following search phrase:
				<br><i>“REQUEST=GetCapabilities” and “SERVICE=WMS”</i>
				<br>as a single search phrase</h3>
	    <h2>Question 1</h2>
	    	<h3>What search engine did you use?</h3>
        		<p>I used Google Search</p>
      	<h2>Question 2</h2>
        	<h3>How many 'hits' did you get?</h3>
        		<p>242,000 hits</p>
	    <h2>Question 3</h2>
	     	<h3>How useful (generally in terms of getting a pointers to live WMS services [defined as a functioning GetCapabilities request]) were the ‘hits’?</h3>
       			 <p></p>
       		<h3><i>Pick two of the services that included live "GetCapabilities" requests that you found above, and answer the following questions about each.</i></h3>
       	<h2>Question 4 (Service 1)</h2>
       		<h3>What is the URL for the full GetCapabilities request to the service?
			<br>What is the Name of the service?
			<br>What Format(s) are available for GetMap requests from the service?
			<br>How many layers are included in the service (including nesting layers)?</h3>
