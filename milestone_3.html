  <h1>Milestone 3</h1>
	<h2>Question 1</h2> 
		<h3>What area do you want to depict in your map? Why?</h3>
        	<p>I want to depict the City of Albuquerque park space. I am interested in showing the access that people have to natural public space.</p>
    <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <h3>What is the center point (latitude and longitude) of your area of interest?</h3>
    		<p>The center point of the map is (35.0824099,-106.6764794) which is the Google coordinates for the City of Albuquerque.</p>
	<h2>Question 3</h2>
	    <h3>What style of map (roads, satellite, hybrid, terrain) is an appropriate for your map? Why?</h3>
      		<p><i>Roads</i> style for the map is most appropriate because the color blocking of land use type makes reading locations for parks more fluid.</p>
	<h2>Question 4</h2>
		<h3>What is the scale of your map (local, regional, continental, global)? How will this translate into your selection of an appropriate default zoom level for your map?</h3>
			<p>This map is on a local scale. This scale is ideal because it shows enough detail for the reader to differentiate between developed land and park space. It is also ideal to show where these park spaces are located in the Albuquerque area.</p>
	<h2>Question 5</h2>
		<h3>Embed a Google Map in your writeup that is based upon your responses above.</h3>
				<p>Here it is:</p>
